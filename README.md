Senior Project 2019

This web app will make an interface for users to search and find recipes based on
ingredients that they have on hand.

Will feature accounts in which users can store info about recipes that they have made.

Will include comments on recipes, and ability to like and rate both the recipes and their comments.

Will be able to filter out recipes with filters.
